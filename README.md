# Aggregations
This project demonstrates the use of SQL aggregate functions such as:
-COUNT()
-SUM()
-AVG()
-GROUP BY

The goal of this project is to practice data summarization and analytical querying using Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL).

The queries are written against a structured dataset containing property listing information (e.g., price, province, bedrooms, repayment, income requirements).
The dataset was used to simulate real-world business questions such as:
-What is the total property value per province?
-What is the average monthly repayment for high-value properties?
-Which provinces have the most expensive listings?
-What income is typically required for luxury properties?
